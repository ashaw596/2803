		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
		Reverse engineering the brain will finally provide us a partial understanding of how our minds work, something philosophers have been searching for ages. Doing so will not only allow use to create better and better AI based on our own brain’s design, but will allow medical breakthroughs not only in curing mental disorders and diseases like Alzheimer’s, Schizophrenia, or Autism, but even eventually to allowing us to cure paralysis or connect prosthetic limbs to the person’s actual nerves.

		<h1>Genetics of the brain</h1>
		<p>
			One particular direction of research that we are pushing towards is trying to understand the development process of the brain. For example, a research group at the Allen Institute of Brain Science in Seattle just recently analyzed the brains of four fetus’s between 15 and 21 weeks old. The group used tried to correlate their brain development with the expression of certain genes, creating a sort of map for fetal brain development. Doing so, they hope to learn more about how the brain is formed as well the genetics that affect it. This research is already yielding great results in the study of autism. They found that a gene linked with autism is linked to a generation of unusually excited neurons in the area of the brain linked with social behavior. Also by comparing the genes responsible for brain development in humans compared to other animals, we can learn even more about what part of our genome is really responsible for giving us “intelligence”.	</p>

		<h1>Simulating with the Brain</h1>
		<p>
			Henry Markam founded two of the leading projects: The Blue Brain Project and the Human Brain Project.
			<br />The Human Brain Project is a large-scale project that coordinates the work of around many international scientific groups, of which the Blue Brain Project is one, towards a unifying goal.
			<br />The Human Brain Project aims to develop information and communications technology six key research areas: Neuroinformatics Brain simulation, High-performance computing, Medical informatics, Neuromorphic computing and Neurorobotics.
			<br />The initial goal of the Blue Brain Project was to simulate the neocortical column (group of neurons considered to be the smallest functional unit of neocortex) of a rat. This goal was achieved in 2006.
			<br />Currently the focus is on constructing a simulation on the molecular level, which would help us in understanding gene expression, and on ultimately simulating an entire neocortex.

		<h1>Interfacing with the Brain</h1>
		<p>
			Ted Berger, at University of Southern California, is running experiments on artificially transmitting neurotransmitters through the hippocampus. The artificial relay is a circuit board with input and output electrodes. The hippocampus is the area of the brain known to be responsible for converting short-term memories into long-term memories. The underlying difficulty in these experiments is the inherent nonlinearity in brain signals. The output does not directly spur from the input, but is a result of many input waves from different neurons suppressing or accentuating each other. Berger and his team have derived algorithms to mimic these interactions. The chip has successfully bridged lost memories in controlled tests on lab rats and primates.
			<br />
			<br />Berger’s goal is to negate the memory-losing symptoms of Alzheimer’s and other damaged brains in humans. Riding on initial success, the researchers are now beginning to think about how and when to bring their chip to humans. Just 20 years ago, his hypotheses were considered lunatic. Now he and his team are considered neuroscience pioneers. In the next two years, Berger hopes to implant an actual ‘memory prosthesis’ in animals to study a wide variety of behavioral situations, proving or disproving the reach of his equations. Even still, the researchers are collaborating with clinicians at his university to plan human studies, combining his chip with that of his peers – electrodes spanning the hippocampus to detect and prevent seizures in patients with severe epilepsy – to acquire data for further ‘memory code’ patterns.
